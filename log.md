# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Day 1: October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Intermediate JS algorithms. Completed two more challenges.

**Thoughts:** Today was a rough day emotionally for unrelated reasons, so completing anything was hard. I wasn't at 100%, but I'm glad I managed to do something.
