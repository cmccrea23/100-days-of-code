# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Day 1: October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Intermediate JS algorithms. Completed two more challenges.

**Thoughts:** Today was a rough day emotionally for unrelated reasons, so completing anything was hard. I wasn't at 100%, but I'm glad I managed to do something.

# Day 2: October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate Algorithms (finally) and the first project algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm becoming more and more comfortable with JS methods every day. I've noticed that at the beginning of the intermediate algorithms section, my answers usually aligned with the intermediate (sometimes beginning) answers suggested by fCC. At the end, however, my answers tended to align with the advanced answers suggested. I think it shows I'm becoming more comfortable using higher-order functions and methods. Nested arrays and objects still give me a hard time, as does recursion ðŸ¤¯

# Day 3: October 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Cash Register! Started redoing Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Finishing the Javascript Certification today made me feel like I can actually do this; I really can become a dev and change my career. I remember Bootstrap from earlier, so this next section shouldn't take too long.

# Day 4: October 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Bootstrap and jQuery, started Sass.

**Thoughts:** I remembered a lot of Bootstrap stuff, so it was easy, and I needed to redo the jQuery. I'm already thinking of ways to improve the project I finished before. Sass is interesting and tweaks my brain a bit in ways I didn't expect.
