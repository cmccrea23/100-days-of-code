# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Day 1: October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Intermediate JS algorithms. Completed two more challenges.

**Thoughts:** Today was a rough day emotionally for unrelated reasons, so completing anything was hard. I wasn't at 100%, but I'm glad I managed to do something.

# Day 2: October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intermediate Algorithms (finally) and the first project algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm becoming more and more comfortable with JS methods every day. I've noticed that at the beginning of the intermediate algorithms section, my answers usually aligned with the intermediate (sometimes beginning) answers suggested by fCC. At the end, however, my answers tended to align with the advanced answers suggested. I think it shows I'm becoming more comfortable using higher-order functions and methods. Nested arrays and objects still give me a hard time, as does recursion ðŸ¤¯
